completed the core functionalities !!! 
pretty happy with that but there is lot more room for improving upon that 
==> things to improve are 
  1) most important to be able to sign up and be there multiple users 
  	1.1) for this purpose you have to make changes in some core functionality 
  	1.2) add another jsp page
  	1.3) make changes in the db ie. create another one table and add foregin key to todos table that will point out which user have adde that thing 
  2) show to do as the cards which will be more asthetic 
  3) add done checkbox when user will click that then that todo will vanish from to do list
  4) sorting of todos on the basis of differnet priorities 
  5) more esthetics to the website 
  6) deploy it on the Internet
